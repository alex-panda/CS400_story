Jeffrey was on an adventure to meet his Aunt May in a town over yonder. He had packed several things for his journey: a sandwich, a bottle of water, and a small pendant that his Grandfather had given him before he passed. Jeffrey's footfalls fell on a dirt path and his eyes on vast hills and plains around him as he went onward. The birds chirped over head, and there was a nice breeze. It was indeed a very nice day for a mild adventure.

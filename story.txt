Jeffrey was on an adventure to meet his Aunt May in a town over yonder. He had packed several things for his journey: a sandwich, a bottle of water, and a small pendant that his Grandfather had given him before he passed. Jeffrey's footfalls fell on a dirt path and his eyes on vast hills and plains around him as he went onward. The birds chirped over head, and there was a nice breeze. It was indeed a very nice day for a mild adventure.

Jeffrey haven't met his Aunt for a long time, so he was so excited and what to reach his aunt's house as quickly as possible. He jogged over the hills and took the short cut in the forest. He followed the birds and butterflies, passing through the forest happily. He got hungry soon, so he found a deadman, sit down on it, and took out his sandwich. Suddenly, a hungry monkey jumped down from the tree and took his lunch away.

Jeffrey was on an adventure to meet his Aunt May in a town over yonder. He had packed several things for his journey: a sandwich, a bottle of water, and a small pendant that his Grandfather had given him before he passed. Jeffrey's footfalls fell on a dirt path and his eyes on vast hills and plains around him as he went onward. The birds chirped over head, and there was a nice breeze. It was indeed a very nice day for a mild adventure.

Jeffrey haven't met his Aunt for a long time, so he was so excited and what to reach his aunt's house as quickly as possible. He jogged over the hills and took the short cut in the forest. He followed the birds and butterflies, passing through the forest happily. He got hungry soon, so he found a deadman, sit down on it, and took out his sandwich. Suddenly, a hungry monkey jumped down from the tree and took his lunch away.

The monkey ran, but Jeffrey was fast, very fast in fact, so Jeffery chased the monkey. The monkey was an excellent climber and clearly outmatched on foot, so it took to the trees where it thought it could escape Jeffrey. This worried Jeffrey; Jeffrey was not as good at climbing as the monkey. In a sudden act of desperation, motivated by his still looming hunger, he was willing to give up everything just to be fed. He threw his water bottle with all his might. The monkey in the tree was struck, and plummeted to the ground where it layed motionless. As Jeffrey got closer to reclaim that which was taken from him, he couldn't help but feel overcome with a sense of familiarity. When he came to recognize, in full, what lay before him, he was overcome with shock. It was his Aunt May. She was the sandwich the whole time.
